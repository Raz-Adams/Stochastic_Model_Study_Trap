# Project 1: 1D Random Walk Simulation

This project is a simple yet powerful introduction to the world of **stochastic modelling**. It simulates a "Drunkard's Walk," a classic example of a **random walk**, which is a path consisting of a succession of random steps.

This simulation tracks the position of a particle (or our drunkard) on a 1D line over a set number of time steps. We explore two scenarios:
1.  **An Unbiased Walk:** The particle has an equal 50/50 chance of moving left (-1) or right (+1).
2.  **A Biased Walk:** The particle is more likely to move in one direction than the other, demonstrating how a simple bias can dramatically affect the long-term outcome.

This project was built as a foundational step in learning about stochastic processes, a key concept in fields like finance, biology, physics, and engineering.

## Sample Output

Here is a sample visualisation generated by the script. Notice how the biased walk has a clear upward trend, while the unbiased walk ends up in a random position centred around the start.

#### Biased Walk (70% chance of moving right)

## Core Concepts Illustrated

*   **Stochastic Process:** A system that evolves in a way that has inherent randomness. You can't predict the exact outcome, only the probability of different outcomes.
*   **Random Walk:** The path traced by a point that takes successive random steps. Our simulation is a **Discrete-Time Markov Process**.
*   **Bias:** A small change in probabilities (`p=[0.3, 0.7]` instead of `p=[0.5, 0.5]`) that leads to a predictable long-term drift, demonstrating that "random" doesn't always mean "no direction."


# Project 2: Weather Simulation with a Markov Chain

This project simulates daily weather patterns using a **Markov Chain**, a fundamental model in the study of **stochastic systems**. The model predicts tomorrow's weather based *only* on today's weather, demonstrating the "memoryless" property of Markovian processes.

The system has two states: **"Sunny"** and **"Rainy"**. A predefined probability matrix governs the transitions between these states. By simulating the weather for a full year (365 days), we can observe the long-term behaviour and stability of the system.

## Simulation Output

The script generates a bar chart summarising the total number of sunny and rainy days over the simulated period. The exact numbers will vary slightly with each run due to the random nature of the simulation, but they will tend toward a stable distribution.

## Core Concepts

*   **Markov Chain:** A model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.
*   **States:** The distinct conditions the system can be in ("Sunny", "Rainy").
*   **Transition Matrix:** The matrix of probabilities that defines the rules for moving from one state to another.
*   **Stationary Distribution:** The simulation reveals that even with daily randomness, the long-term proportion of sunny and rainy days tends to be stable. This is a key feature of many Markov chains.

# Project 3: Customer Arrival Simulation with a Poisson Process

This project models a real-world scenario of random events occurring over time: customers arriving at a coffee shop. It demonstrates the implementation of a **Poisson Process**, a fundamental model in stochastic systems used for events that happen at a constant average rate but at random intervals.

Instead of fixed time-steps, this simulation operates in **continuous time**. The core of the model is the insight that the waiting time between consecutive events in a Poisson process follows an **Exponential Distribution**. By repeatedly generating random waiting times, we can construct a complete timeline of arrivals.

## Simulation Output

The script simulates customer arrivals over a 3-hour period, assuming an average arrival rate of 10 customers per hour. The output is a timeline visualizing the exact, random moment each customer arrived.

Notice that the arrivals are clustered randomly—some are close together, while others have long gaps. This is the characteristic behaviour of a Poisson process.

## Core Concepts Illustrated

*   **Poisson Process:** The premier model for analysing the timing of random, independent events that occur at a known average rate (λ).
*   **Continuous-Time Modelling:** A leap from discrete-step models (like daily weather changes) to systems where events can happen at any moment.
*   **Exponential Distribution:** The probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process. The simulation's engine is built on generating random numbers from this distribution.
*   **Time-Based Simulation:** The use of a `while` loop that advances a simulation clock, which is a powerful technique for modelling dynamic systems that don't conform to fixed intervals.

## Exploring Further

The model can be easily extended to simulate more complex scenarios. A "bonus challenge" version of this script models a variable arrival rate, such as a "lunch rush" where the customer traffic temporarily triples, providing a more realistic simulation of real-world behaviour.
