# Project 1: 1D Random Walk Simulation

This project is a simple yet powerful introduction to the world of **stochastic modelling**. It simulates a "Drunkard's Walk," a classic example of a **random walk**, which is a path consisting of a succession of random steps.

This simulation tracks the position of a particle (or our drunkard) on a 1D line over a set number of time steps. We explore two scenarios:
1.  **An Unbiased Walk:** The particle has an equal 50/50 chance of moving left (-1) or right (+1).
2.  **A Biased Walk:** The particle is more likely to move in one direction than the other, demonstrating how a simple bias can dramatically affect the long-term outcome.

This project was built as a foundational step in learning about stochastic processes, a key concept in fields like finance, biology, physics, and engineering.

## Sample Output

Here is a sample visualisation generated by the script. Notice how the biased walk has a clear upward trend, while the unbiased walk ends up in a random position centred around the start.

#### Biased Walk (70% chance of moving right)

## Core Concepts Illustrated

*   **Stochastic Process:** A system that evolves in a way that has inherent randomness. You can't predict the exact outcome, only the probability of different outcomes.
*   **Random Walk:** The path traced by a point that takes successive random steps. Our simulation is a **Discrete-Time Markov Process**.
*   **Bias:** A small change in probabilities (`p=[0.3, 0.7]` instead of `p=[0.5, 0.5]`) that leads to a predictable long-term drift, demonstrating that "random" doesn't always mean "no direction."

## Getting Started

To run this simulation on your machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3 and the following libraries installed:
*   NumPy
*   Matplotlib

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine (or just download the `random_walk.py` file).
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and install the necessary libraries using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

## Running the Simulation

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the Python script:
```bash
python random_walk.py
```

# Project 2: Weather Simulation with a Markov Chain

This project simulates daily weather patterns using a **Markov Chain**, a fundamental model in the study of **stochastic systems**. The model predicts tomorrow's weather based *only* on today's weather, demonstrating the "memoryless" property of Markovian processes.

The system has two states: **"Sunny"** and **"Rainy"**. The transitions between these states are governed by a predefined probability matrix. By simulating the weather for a full year (365 days), we can observe the long-term behavior and stability of the system.

## Simulation Output

The script generates a bar chart summarizing the total number of sunny and rainy days over the simulated period. The exact numbers will vary slightly with each run due to the random nature of the simulation, but they will tend toward a stable distribution.

## Core Concepts

*   **Markov Chain:** A model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.
*   **States:** The distinct conditions the system can be in ("Sunny", "Rainy").
*   **Transition Matrix:** The matrix of probabilities that defines the rules for moving from one state to another.
*   **Stationary Distribution:** The simulation reveals that even with daily randomness, the long-term proportion of sunny and rainy days tends to be stable. This is a key feature of many Markov chains.
